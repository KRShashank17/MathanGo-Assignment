I'm a recent graduate with a strong 8.53 CGPA in CSE from The National Institute of Engineering (Mysuru). My passion for software development is evident by actively solving over 700 problems on LeetCode (including a 200+ day coding streak!). See my problem-solving skills in action at https://leetcode.com/krshashank1118/.

In addition to theoretical knowledge, I possess practical experience building web applications and backend systems (check out my projects on GitHub: https://github.com/KRShashank17)
